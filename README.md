# Health Tracker App
This app allows users to post new health notes and see previous notes that they wrote.  This was built using React for the frontend and Express and MySQL for the backend.

## Getting Started
1. Download or clone repository.
2. In the terminal, change the directory to the api folder using the command `cd api`.
3. In this folder, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies and then run the command `npm start` to start the app.
4. If needed, you can run the command `npm run seed` in this same folder to refresh the database content and populate with seed data.
5. Next, change the directory to the client folder using the command `cd client`.
6. In this folder, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies and then run the command `npm start` to start the app.
7. The React app will be open up in your browser with [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/).
